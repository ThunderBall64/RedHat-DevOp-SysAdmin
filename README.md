# RedHat-DevOp-SysAdmin
To my fellow Alfred State  CISY class mates who withered through the pain of Linux/Unix Admin, this is where I learned how to script. I owe a HUGE thanks to Jason Cannon!

Learn how to shell script through project-based training (Bash Scripting, Bash Programming, Sed, Grep, Awk, and More)

If you plan on following this reposoity, I recommend you install virtualbox.

You also need Vagrant.

I also recommend Git Bash
